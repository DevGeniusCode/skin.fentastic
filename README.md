# FENtastic Kodi Skin

FENtastic is a modded version of the default Estuary skin, specifically designed for FEN users. It includes several new features and adjustments to pre-existing views, including new viewtypes, customizable widgets, and a new default colors theme.

## FENtastic vs Default Estuary Skin

Here are some of the key differences between FENtastic and the default Estuary skin.

* **New viewtypes**: FENtastic introduces "WideWall" and "WideInfoWall" viewtypes.

On FIRST install go to Settings » Interface » in the Skin section click Configure skin... » Extra info » Setup Guide. Here you will find some tips on setting up your main menu paths and widgets. I have also included the step by step Setup Guide below.

## Setup Guide

On first install, the home screen should be empty. This means that the Movie and Show sections should be missing from the main menu on the left.

To set up the widgets, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings » Interface » in the Skin section click Configure skin... » Extra info » Setup Guide.
   ![Step 1](images/step_1.png)
2. From the dialog screen, click Back on your remote or Backspace if you are using a keyboard. Here you'll see a group of menu items on the left. Navigate up to Main menu items.
   ![Step 2](images/step_2.png)
3. Click a menu item to toggle the display of a section on and off. This will show or hide the section on the home screen. Toggle the Movie/Show section to 'on'. You'll see a couple of menu items drop down.

4. To set up the main menu path, click on "Set main menu path." You can set this to whatever path you like within FEN. For example, you might set it to your Trakt movie/tvshow collection.
   ![Step 4](images/step_4.png)
5. To set up the movie/tvshow widgets, click on "Set widgets." You can configure up to 10 movie and 10 TV show widgets. After choosing a path, you'll have the option to set the label and display type (Poster, Landscape, LandscapeInfo, and Category) for each widget. If you choose the Category display type, you'll have the option to set it up as a stacked widget. After that, you can choose the display type for the stacked widget as well.

## Stacked Widgets

Stacked widgets contain a category widget and a normal widget beneath. The category widget "communicates" with the normal widget in order to load the new widget list according to the focused item in the category widget. If the stacked widget that you set up has 20 items in it, then that means you'll be able to have all 20 widgets available from just one widget on the home screen.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues while using FENtastic, please follow these guidelines before opening an Issue:

- Read the **CHANGELOG**. As new updates get released features are added, changed, modified or removed. *Before opening an Issue* related to this make sure you read the changelog (located at the bottom of Skin settings in Extra info) as it will contain information for all the changes made to each update. It is also a good way to stay current with what is new with the skin.
- **Pre-made builds** of any kind are *not supported*. If you installed someone else's build, you need to go to them to troubleshoot issues. These builds often contain a plethora of addons so any number of things could go wrong. Keep in mind this skin was designed exclusively for use with **FEN**.
- Trakt related Issues are *not supported*. These are not skin related. You'll need to contact the developer of the addon that you are experiencing these types of problems/errors with.
- Error related Issues **MUST** include a log file. Your Issue will be closed immediately if you fail to include a log file.
- Make sure to check all open Issues to see if your problem is being addressed already.
- **DO NOT** hijack an open Issue with unrelated problems. Open a new Issue.
- Do your best to **monitor** the Issue you have opened. If I need additional information and it is not supplied within 7 days, I will close the Issue.
